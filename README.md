# Crossy Road Recreation in Unreal Engine 5
Welcome to the Crossy Road Recreation project built using Unreal Engine 5. This project is a remake of the popular arcade game Crossy Road, where the player guides a character through busy streets, rivers, and train tracks while avoiding obstacles. The goal is to move forward as far as possible without getting hit or falling into the water. The project is yet to be finished, however it has a good base.

# Features
Player Movement: Character moves forward, backward, left, right, and jump using keyboard input.  
Dynamic Obstacles: Vehicles, trains, and other obstacles move along paths.  
Randomized Environment: The level is constantly being generated in front of you as you play the game.  
Score System: A scoring system that tracks how far the player has traveled and awards points based on progression.  
High-Quality Visuals: Utilizes Unreal Engine 5’s advanced lighting and rendering features to deliver high-quality visuals.  
Audio and Effects: Custom sound effects for player actions and environmental elements (vehicles, trains, water splash).  
Game Over & Restart: The game ends when the player is hit by a vehicle, falls into the water, or doesn't move fast enough.
